- **GET /api/applications** - Retrieve all applications with filtering
- **GET /api/applications/pending** - Get pending applications only
- **PUT /api/applications/:id/approve** - Approve single application
- **POST /api/applications/bulk-approve** - Bulk approve multiple applications

### Frontend Components
- **NewApplicationModal.tsx** - Multi-step application form with success feedback
- **ApprovePendingLoansModal.tsx** - Pending applications management
- **Dashboard.tsx** - Real-time metrics with auto-refresh

### Database Schema
```sql
LoanApplication {
  id: string (PK)
  applicationId: string (unique, sequential)
  status: enum (PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED)
  borrowerId: string (FK)
  requestedAmount: decimal
  submittedAt: datetime
}

Borrower {
  id: string (PK)
  borrowerId: string (unique, sequential)
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: string
  phone: string
}

Loan {
  id: string (PK)
  loanId: string (unique, sequential)
  borrowerId: string (FK)
  principal: decimal
  interestRate: decimal
  totalInterest: decimal
  status: enum
}
```

   ```
   User fills form â†’ Sequential ID generated â†’ Application saved with PENDING status 
   â†’ Borrower created â†’ Success message displayed â†’ Dashboard refreshed
   ```

2. **Application Approval**
   ```
   Admin opens Approve Pending Modal â†’ Selects applications â†’ Bulk approve 
   â†’ Loans created with sequential IDs â†’ Dashboard metrics updated
   ```

3. **Real-time Updates**
   ```
   Any application/approval action â†’ Dashboard auto-refresh triggered 
   â†’ Metrics recalculated â†’ UI updated with latest data
