### âœ… What Was Accomplished

1. **Dynamic Borrower Generation**: Borrowers are now generated from applications data
2. **Real Names Restored**: All applications show proper names like MUKKIRIZA HERBERT, MAGYEZI ALBERT, MUTESASIRA DENIS

   - Loan amount (lower amounts = higher scores)
   - Purpose (business/education = higher scores)

   - Random variability for realistic distribution
