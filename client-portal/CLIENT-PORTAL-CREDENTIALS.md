## Updates Made
‚úÖ Added divider line under the logo
‚úÖ Changed text from "Buy new products" to "Manage your loans"
‚úÖ Changed text from "Make claims" to "Apply for new loans"

## Current Status

The Client Portal UI is fully functional and styled, but the backend authentication endpoints for clients need to be implemented.

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ Beautiful login page with money background and green overlay
- ‚úÖ Sharp-edged buttons and inputs
- ‚úÖ PT Sans Caption font throughout
- ‚úÖ QuickCredit logo with divider line
- ‚úÖ Responsive design
- ‚úÖ Form validation on frontend

### What Needs Implementation:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend API endpoint: `/api/client/auth/login`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend API endpoint: `/api/client/auth/register`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend API endpoint: `/api/client/auth/verify`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Client portal routes in backend
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Borrower authentication logic

### Admin Dashboard Credentials (Working):
For the admin dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`:
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`

### Temporary Solution for Testing:

To test the client portal functionality, you'll need to:

1. **Option 1: Create Backend Endpoints**
   - Create a new route file: `backend/src/routes/clientAuth.ts`
   - Implement borrower login/register endpoints
   - Connect to the Borrower table in the database
   - Add phone number authentication

2. **Option 2: Use Mock Data** 
   - The frontend will show login errors until backend is connected
   - Can test the UI and UX flows
   - All styling and design is complete

3. **Option 3: Quick Demo Setup**
   - Add a demo borrower account to the database
   - Phone: `+256700000000`
   - Password: `demo123`
   - Connect client portal auth to backend

### Next Steps:
1. Start the backend server on port 3002
2. Implement client authentication routes
3. Test login flow with demo borrower account
4. Verify dashboard loads after successful login

### Current Service Status:
- ‚úÖ Client Portal Frontend: Running on http://localhost:3001
- ‚ùå Backend API: Not running (needed for authentication)
- ‚ùå Client Auth Endpoints: Not implemented yet

Would you like me to create the backend authentication endpoints for the client portal?
